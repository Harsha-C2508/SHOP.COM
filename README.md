# SHOP.COM
SHOP.COM
    Hai everyone, For the last few days I was just trying to make a clone of SHOP.COM . This was my first individual project in Masai school. 
It took almost 6 days to make my website completely perfect.

Introduction:

    During those 6 days I have struggled a lot and those days taught me many valuable things.
I would like to compare my situation to a saying i.e. performing a group item alone . This was 
the exact situation I have faced during my 
initial days but day by day I have come up with more confidence.
 
Tool used:

The tools that I have used for my project is:
#HTML 
#CSS
#JS
#Font Awesome
#Font style

How I Achieve It:

 I had a deadline of 6 days . First and foremost thing that I have done is to divide the tasks according to the days . 
Try to complete the task within the end of day and most properly the task completed by the day. If I face any issues I ask queries to my friends and mentors too .
Also had long hours of googling.

Home page:

    Home page is the space where all will evaluate a website . It was perfectly made as a crystal copy of a real website . For 
 coding the home page I did a lot of google search for long hours and did it perfectly. This page contains lots of live 
 updates and I made our website responsive .

Sign In Page:

   In the sign IN page we have to enter our email Id and Password . If you are a new member to my website then before sign In you have to create an
account on the website. In the account creating page you have to fill the form with valuable and real information.
Products Page:

     In this page you can see products' image , price , off-price , type of items , color , brand , company etc.
     
PageCart Page:

    Here in this page you see the product you have chosen , its rate , total rate etc. And different ways of payment facilities.
    
Thankyou:

    After selecting the product while checking out you will be landing to a new land .
    
Conclusion:

 Six days is a short time to achieve anything great. Yet, in these six days I have cloned a website to my liking. 
 I had struggled a lot in those days but at the last day I was happy to see my website .
